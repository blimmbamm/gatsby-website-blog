Hi there, I'm Robin and I welcome you to my website!

I'm a software developer from Germany and I like to explore new technologies. My software career began, say, quite late, during my final year of school, when I somehow stumpled upon a Java tutorial series on YouTube and started experimenting. 

I remember that one of those self-assigned tasks was to implement the [Laplace algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion) for a matrix' determinant. I found it quite challenging (as a complete coding beginner!), because of its recursive nature and 2d-array slicing. Another project I remember was to explore Android's device gravity sensor, building an simple app that moves a ball on screen depending on how the device is held. However, any of this source code is long lost on some old computer - but the foundation was set!

By then, it was time to decide what to do with my life and I decided to study mathematics, with the aim to become some quantitative financial analyst (earning a lot of money  😂). Studies were really tough and time-consuming, so I had to stop my programming journey and start focussing on mainly very theoretic mathematical things. Luckily, programming came back to me in statistics where I learned to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) ♥️ for analytical tasks. 

After my first degree, I dropped the idea of the financial/banking career thing and focussed on data science topics, inspired by an internship at an insurance company. I finished my Master's degree with a thesis on neural networks.

I then began my career in the insurance industry at a Big 4 consultancy. I mainly did quantitative data things with R and Python, and although I was quite successful in my job, I didn't like the actual topics of my department too much. Some project I was working on was dealing with web scraping, and that's what led me to web development. 

I was faced with lots of things I did'nt understand, so I decided to buy an online web development bootcamp course - best decision ever made, because I found my passion there!

Server-side-rendered websites and simple web APIs using Node, Express, plain CSS and some templating language - that's what I started with, but soon I understood the "need" of declarative frontend frameworks and thus started learning React. 

And now, I work as a frontend developer in a new company and build enterprise-level web application UIs in both React and Angular. Although I don't touch the backend very often, I also love exploring technologies there, like new ORMs or GraphQL.

However, to sum things up, I like frontend better, because frontend brings together coding and visual creativity.

And last, a cite that describes quite well my decisions in life so far:
