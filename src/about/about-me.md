Hello there, I'm Robin.

I like coding and exploring new technolgies. Especially web frontend technologies like React and Angular keep me occupied. 

I also like running. Running up some hill or mountain, fields, forest, doesn't matter - if exhausting enough. 😁

Ok, that's all.

Here's a cite from some unknown person that I stumbled upton and that I wanna share with you:
