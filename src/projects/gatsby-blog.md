Previously, when I wanted to show my projects to someone, I always shared my GitHub. But in the beginning of this year, I thought it was time to create my own website. 

Since I also wanted to add a blog in addition to my projects, I decided to go with a static site generator. I did some research and was in fact about to start with Eleventy - when I somehow stumpled upon Gatsby. I immediately knew that Gatsby was my way to go, because, well, it uses React. 

So, here is my page. I use markdown to write the content and then inject everything with `transformer-remark`. I use some other plugins as well, like e.g. the `prism` plugin, to do the code highlighting.
